# nzelect-stv

I plan to put an STV simulator on this, however needed to start with data, so it's currently just a scraper.

## Running

    yarn install

    yarn run start

Check output.json for all your data needs. It should be stringified output

## Contrib

Feel free to contrib with pull requests and all the other stuff.

Plan will be to put stuff into break out the code a bit more, allow combinations of electorates, and run simulated STV rankings based on the data there (yes I know it's all hypothetical, but doing it for the lulz)

## Warning

* Check the timestamp on the output.json file, as this is committed to this repo purely for ease of data access.
* This will probably break when the elections are over completely
* I do not gaurantee the quality of the data
